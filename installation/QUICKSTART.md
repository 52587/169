## Tips for Best Results

### Sound Tips
- 🎤 **Voice**: Clear speaking or singing works great
- 👏 **Percussive**: Clapping, snapping create bursts
- 🎵 **Music**: Play instruments or music near mic
- 🤫 **Quiet**: Whispers create subtle effects
- 📢 **Loud**: Shouting creates dramatic visuals

### Interaction Tips
- Try **sustained tones** (ahhh...) for flowing effects
- Try **staccato sounds** (beat boxing) for rhythmic patterns
- **Vary volume** to see different intensities
- **Experiment** with pitch (high vs. low)
- **Collaborate** with others for complexity

### Visual Tips
- **Dark room** = better projection
- **Closer viewing** = more immersive
- **Longer interaction** = layered effects build
- **Mode switching** = discover different aesthetics
