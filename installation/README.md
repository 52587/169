## üé® Concept

**Sonic Echo Chamber** is an immersive digital installation that transforms sound into persistent visual echoes, exploring themes of memory, presence, and the collective nature of human voice. Participants' sounds create layered, evolving visualizations that fade slowly over time‚Äîmaking the invisible visible.

### Key Themes
- **Memory & Impermanence**: Visual echoes that persist and fade
- **Collective Experience**: Layered voices creating complex patterns
- **Presence in Space**: Awareness of sonic occupation
- **Meditative Technology**: Art through interactive computation

## üîß Customization

### Modifying Visualizations
Edit `visualizations.js` to adjust:
- Particle count and behavior
- Color mappings
- Animation speeds
- Decay rates

### Adding New Color Schemes
Add to the `colorSchemes` object in `visualizations.js`:
```javascript
newScheme: {
    primary: [R, G, B],
    secondary: [R, G, B],
    accent: [R, G, B],
    glow: [R, G, B]
}
```

### Adjusting Sensitivity
Modify default sensitivity in `app.js`:
```javascript
this.sensitivity = 2.0; // Increase for more responsiveness
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### No Audio Input
- Check microphone permissions in browser
- Verify microphone is selected in dropdown
- Test microphone in system settings
- Try refreshing the page

### Poor Performance
- Close other browser tabs
- Reduce window size (before going fullscreen)
- Try Chrome/Edge for better performance
- Update graphics drivers

### Visualizations Not Appearing

- Ensure JavaScript is enabled
- Try a different browser
- Clear browser cache

### Audio Level Too Low/High
- Adjust sensitivity slider
- Move closer/farther from microphone
- Check system audio input levels
- Test with different sound types
