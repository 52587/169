## üêõ Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Microphone not detected
**Solution**: 
- Check Windows Sound Settings ‚Üí Input
- Grant browser permissions (click lock icon in address bar)
- Use Chrome or Edge for best compatibility
- Try `mic-test.html` to diagnose

### Issue: Audio level very low
**Solution**:
- Increase sensitivity slider
- Check Windows microphone volume
- Move closer to microphone
- Ensure mic is not muted

### Issue: Performance lag
**Solution**:
- Use Echo Particles or Waveform (lighter than Ripples)
- Close other browser tabs
- Use modern computer with dedicated GPU
- Reduce browser window size before fullscreen

## üí° Tips for Presentation

### Emphasize These Points:
1. **Conceptual Depth**: Not just a visualizer, explores memory and collective experience
2. **Technical Achievement**: Real-time audio processing with beautiful visuals
3. **Scalability**: Works from laptop to gallery installation
4. **Immersive Design**: Thoughtful consideration of space and experience
5. **Budget Conscious**: Viable at multiple price points

### Demo Tips:
- Start with quiet sounds to show sensitivity
- Build to louder sounds for drama
- Show all three modes
- Explain artistic meaning, not just technical features
- Use fullscreen for impact

## üé¨ Example Artistic Statement

*"Sonic Echo Chamber explores the persistence of sound in space and the collective nature of human voice. In our daily lives, sounds disappear the moment we stop making them‚Äîbut what if they didn't? What if we could see the traces our voices leave in space?*

*This installation makes the invisible visible. When you speak, sing, or make sound, you create visual echoes that layer and interact with the sounds of others. These echoes fade slowly, like memory, creating a visible history of sonic presence.*

*The work invites contemplation on how we occupy space with sound, how our individual voices combine into collective experience, and the beauty of impermanence. It's a meditative space where technology serves not to distract, but to deepen our awareness of the present moment."*
