## Slide 2: Concept Overview

**What is Sonic Echo Chamber?**

An immersive digital installation that transforms sound into persistent visual echoes, exploring themes of:

- 🎵 **Memory & Impermanence** - Visual traces that fade over time
- 👥 **Collective Experience** - Layered voices creating patterns together
- 🌊 **Presence in Space** - Making the invisible (sound) visible
- 🧘 **Meditative Technology** - Art through interactive computation

*"Making the invisible visible, one sound at a time."*

---

## Slide 3: Artistic Statement

**Why This Installation?**

This project explores how technology can create spaces for contemplation and connection. By visualizing sound, participants become aware of:

- How we occupy space with our voices
- The persistence of our presence (even after we stop speaking)
- The beauty of collective sound and shared experience
- The impermanence of moments (as echoes fade)

**Inspiration**: teamLab, Meow Wolf, Ryoji Ikeda, James Turrell

[Include images of inspiring installations]

## Slide 4: Interaction Design

**How Participants Interact**

1. **Approach** the darkened installation space
2. **Make sounds**: speak, sing, whisper, clap
3. **Observe** visual echoes appear and persist
4. **Experiment** with different sounds and volumes
5. **Collaborate** with others for complex patterns

**Input**: Microphone captures all sounds in the space  
**Output**: Real-time generative visualizations  
**Experience**: Immediate feedback creates engagement

[Include diagram or photos of interaction]

## Slide 5: Visualization Modes

**Three Distinct Visual Experiences**

### Echo Particles
- Sounds spawn glowing particles
- Particles persist and fade slowly
- Creates visual memory of sound history
- Different frequencies = different colors

### Fluid Waveform
- Organic, living waveforms
- Responds to pitch and amplitude
- Multiple layers for depth
- Perlin noise for natural movement

### Radial Ripples
- Sound emanates from center
- Mandala-like circular patterns
- Low frequencies = large ripples
- Hypnotic rotation effect

[Include screenshots of each mode]

## Slide 12: Making It Immersive

**Scale Creates Immersion**

### Why Digital Can Be Immersive
- **Large projection** fills peripheral vision
- **Darkness** removes external distractions
- **Immediate feedback** creates presence
- **Persistence** shows temporal dimension
- **Beauty** encourages contemplation

### Immersion Through Design
- No visible technology (hidden mics, computers)
- Minimal UI (only control kiosk)
- Ambient elements support, don't distract
- Comfortable viewing encourages longer stays

**Result**: Technology disappears, experience remains

## Slide 19: Artist Statement

**Personal Reflection**

"In creating Sonic Echo Chamber, I wanted to explore how digital technology can create spaces for contemplation and human connection. We live in a world where so much happens invisibly—our voices disappear the moment we stop speaking. This installation makes sound visible and persistent, creating awareness of our presence and the beauty of shared experience.

The slow fade of visual echoes mirrors human memory—vivid at first, gradually fading but leaving traces. When multiple people interact simultaneously, their sounds layer and combine, creating something no one person could make alone. This is the magic of collective experience.

I hope this installation offers a moment of reflection in our busy world, a space to play with sound and light, and an opportunity to see the invisible made visible."
